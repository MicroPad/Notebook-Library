µPad, also known as *MicroPad*, is a note taking application that is built upon the principles of power and openness.

µPad acts like a whiteboard to take notes on, rather than a linear metaphor, like a page.

*Last Updated for µPad v3.5.0-alpha*</markdown></note><note title="Licence" time="2017-05-02T17:17:13.512+12:00"><addons/><bibliography/><markdown id="markdown1" x="10px" y="10px" width="auto" height="auto" fontSize="16px"># Core/Web v3

- You can now dismiss the instructional videos
- There's some automated asset clean-up. Whenever you refresh we now make sure that we're not storing anything we don't need to
- The *Difference Engine*
	- What's that? I'm glad you asked. The *Difference Engine* (DE) is the brand new fancy sync system that will power µSync for µPad v3. It's a replacement for *Puddle*, which powered the old µSync.
	- What's new about it?
		- It's been completely rewritten in a much more stable and less error-prone way
		- Anyone can get an account
		- The API is much cleaner and some documentation will be coming (I promise)
		- The risk of data corruption has been massively reduced
		- The amount of data required to be transferred for each sync has been drastically reduced
		- Oh, and it's free for any notepads with less than 10 non-text elements</markdown></note></section><section title="General Use"><note title="µPad Text Formatting Guide for People in a Hurry" time="2017-05-02T17:15:33.650+12:00"><addons/><bibliography/><markdown id="markdown1" x="10px" y="10px" width="727px" height="auto" fontSize="16px"><![CDATA[µPad uses *[GitHub Flavoured Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)* as a base for its formatting, so feel free to read their guide for a more complete tutorial. There is a pretty good chance you have used #Markdown before, it's the formatting system on [Reddit](https://reddit.com), [Discord](https://discordapp.com), and more.

## The Basics
### Creating a new line
In Markdown you can hit
enter at anytime you would like to make the underlying text look prettier. However, this won't insert a new line at all.

You can insert a new line by putting two spaces at the end of a line *before* pressing enter, like so:
```
this·is·a·line··
and·I·broke·it.
```

this is a line
and I broke it.

### Creating a new paragraph
Creating a new paragraph is simple! Just hit enter twice :smile:

Like so:
paragraph1

paragraph2

### Bold, Italics, and strike-through
```
I want to be **bold**, *fast*, and ~~col~~ cool.
```

I want to be **bold**, *fast*, and ~~col~~ cool.

### Links
Creating a link is pretty simple:
```
[text for link](https://example.com)
```

[text for link](https://example.com)

### Headings
Markdown allows you to create headings super quickly:
```
# Heading
# Sub-heading
### Sub-sub-heading
#### Maybe *too* much organisation
```
<hr />
# Heading
# Sub-heading
### Sub-sub-heading
#### Maybe *too* much organisation
<hr />

## More Advanced Formatting
### Lists
Creating lists in Markdown couldn't  be simpler:
```
- just
- do
- this
* or
	* this
		- and stuff
```

- just
- do
- this
* or
	* this
		- and stuff

### Todo Lists
A todo list is just a list with a little `[ ]` next to it:
```
- [ ] like
- [] this
- [x] and I did this one
```

- [ ] like
- [] this
- [x] and I did this one

### Quotes
Quotes are great for calling out a key bit of information, or you know, a quote :laughing:
```
> This is a quote
> - Nick Webster
```

> This is a quote
> - Nick Webster

### Inline Images
You can always use an image element, but if you want to do it within markdown it is like so:
```
![](https://via.placeholder.com/32x32)
![](https://nick.geek.nz/coco.jpg =200x*)
```

![](https://via.placeholder.com/32x32)
![](https://nick.geek.nz/images/coco.jpg =200x*)

### Tables
You can write out a table like so:
```
| Header 1 | Header 2 |
|--|--|
| Hello | World |
| This is a guide | Guides are good |
```

| Header 1 | Header 2 |
|--|--|
| Hello | World |
| This is a guide | Guides are good |

## µPad Specific Formatting
### Hashtags
Hashtags are a great way to unify a bunch of notes together. One example is to put #todo on all your notes that have things you need to get done in them. It's as simple as putting a hashtag in a Markdown element in a note.

### [AsciiMath](http://asciimath.org)
AsciiMath is a great way to write maths very quickly. The website linked above has a number of the commands you can use with it, but there are many that aren't listed. Generally it supports all the ;;\LaTeX;; commands (just without the `\`) alongside a number of shorter alternatives like `:.` for '':.''.

Using ASCIIMath in your code is simple:
```
===a^2 = b^2 + c^2===
''a^2 = b^2 + c^2'' (that's two apostrophes ' not a quotation mark ")
```

===a^2 = b^2 + c^2===
''a^2 = b^2 + c^2'' (that's two apostrophes ' not a quotation mark ")

### LaTeX
For more powerful maths you can always use ;;\LaTeX;; like so:
```
;;a^2 = b^2 + c^2;;
```

;;a^2 = b^2 + c^2;;]]></markdown></note><note title="Keyboard Shortcuts" time="2017-05-02T17:34:32.349+12:00"><addons/><bibliography/><markdown id="markdown1" x="10px" y="10px" width="auto" height="auto" fontSize="16px"># Web + Desktop App

Notepads act like the binder that everything else goes in.

Inside a notepad you can have as many sections as you want.

## Section
Sections are the parents of notes and more sections. You can have as many notes as you like in a section, and as many sub-sections as you would like.

By nesting sections you can create a well organised notepad.

### Note
Notes are like a whiteboard, you can put an element anywhere on the page. There is no limit to how many elements you can have on a note, or how wide/long a note can be.

#### Element
- Appear as cards on the note
- Can be
	- Text (formatted with #markdown)
	- Images
	- Drawings
	- Recordings
	- and more

#### Bibliography
Every element in a note can have URLs attached to it so you can keep track of where you got the information from.

You can have as many sources as you like in your bibliography.</markdown><drawing id="drawing1" x="386.79998779296875px" y="433.20001220703125px" width="auto" height="auto" ext="75dffe4d-bb75-2975-984d-9e43f911d675">AS</drawing></note></section><section title="Development"><section title="Open Notepad XML (NPX)"><note title="Introduction" time="2017-05-02T18:58:58.581+12:00"><addons/><bibliography/><markdown id="markdown1" x="10px" y="10px" width="700px" height="auto" fontSize="16px"><![CDATA[Note: *the following guidelines will work but were written before the asset system was introduced.*
